### Shakespeare play text prediction

We made a text generator producing a script to Shakepeare's play using Hidden Markov Model using a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays .

The process is fully documented in [Jupiter Notebook](https://github.com/jancpp/machine_learning_hw2/blob/master/ML%20-%20Shakespeare%20play%20text%20prediction.ipynb)
